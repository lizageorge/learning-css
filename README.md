## This is where I will compile all of my notes on various Pluralsight courses on CSS.

## Log:
	- January 19 - March 17, 2020 = Introduction to CSS
	- March 17 - March 25 = Introduction to Bootstrap    
	- March 25 = Web Layouts with Flexbot and Bootstrap ( I realized after this day that this course wasn't what I was looking for)
	- March 29 - April 4 = The Bootstrap 4 Bootcamp
